# Cv

Now it's time to describe this project, in all others projects I'll use ready libraries
like [AngularMaterial](https://material.angular.io/) or [PrimeNg](https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/),
but in this project I'll show that I know HTML & CSS pretty well to.
I think now I have all needed components, so I start worst part of project for me -design.
//PLEAS DON'T BLAME ME FOR A FATAL DESIGN BUT I'M DEVELOPER NOT A DESIGNER, BUT I TRY TO DO ALL BY MYSELF!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
